# IR files

Impulse Response (IR) files are audio recordings that capture the acoustic characteristics of physical spaces. These files are used to simulate realistic reverb effects through convolution.

Please put your IR files in this folder to access the Reverb effect. A recommended source is the [OpenAIR Library](https://www.openairlib.net), where you can find many IR files under the CC0 license (Public Domain).
